Giro - "turn" in Spanish - is one of tango's most dynamic and impressive figures. This movement, where the follower rotates around the leader or they turn together, is woven into tango's DNA.

<GamzeQuote>
Giro is two bodies dancing with one heart, around one center. A combination of trust, connection, and music.
