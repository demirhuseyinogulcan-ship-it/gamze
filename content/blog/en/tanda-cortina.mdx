When you first go to a milonga, you'll notice that music plays in a certain order. After a few songs, completely different music plays, everyone stops, and partners change. This system is **tanda** and **cortina** - the heartbeat of the milonga.

<GamzeQuote>
Dancing with the same partner throughout a tanda is like completing a conversation. The cortina is saying "thank you for the lovely conversation."
</GamzeQuote>

## Cortina Rules

### When the Cortina Comes

1. **Dancing stops** - Even mid-song
2. **Thank your partner** - "Thank you, that was lovely"
3. **Clear the floor** - Everyone returns to their table
4. **Change partners** - New partner for new tanda

### Cortina Music

DJs choose non-tango music for cortinas:
- Pop songs
- Jazz
- Latin music
- Electronic
- Anything (except tango!)

<Callout type="tip" title="Recognizing the Cortina">
A cortina usually lasts 20-60 seconds. If the music is completely different and everyone stops and returns to tables, it's a cortina.
</Callout>

## Partner Change

### Why Different Partners Each Tanda?

1. **Socializing:** Meeting more people
2. **Development:** Dancing with different styles
3. **Equality:** Everyone gets a chance
4. **Tradition:** Part of tango culture

### Leaving Mid-Tanda

**Under normal circumstances:** You dance with the same partner until the tanda ends.

**Exceptions:**
- Physical discomfort
- Safety issue
- Very bad behavior

<Callout type="warning" title="Note">
Leaving your partner mid-tanda is considered rude, especially in milonga culture. It should only be done for serious reasons.
</Callout>

### How Many Tandas to Dance?

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| First meeting | 1 tanda |
| Someone you know | 1-2 tandas |
| Romantic interest | 2-3 tandas |
| Partner/spouse | As many as you want |

In Buenos Aires, 3+ tandas is considered a sign of romantic interest!
