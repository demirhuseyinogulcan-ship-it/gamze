## For Women

### Dress and Skirt Selection

**Ideal Skirt/Dress:**
- Below knee or midi length
- Opens when turning (A-line, circle skirt)
- Allows freedom of movement
- Body-hugging but not restricting

**Things to Avoid:**
- Too long (gets tangled in feet)
- Too short (sitting problem)
- Too tight (restricts movement)
- Too slippery fabric

<Callout type="tip" title="Skirt Test">
Do a few pivots and ochos in your skirt at home. Is it comfortable? Does it open? Does it tangle in your feet?
</Callout>

### Upper Garments

**Good Options:**
- Blouse
- Wrap top
- Tank top (covered shoulders preferred)
- Knit top (be careful on warm nights)

**Things to Consider:**
- Not too low-cut

- Sweat-absorbing fabric

### Can Pants Be Worn?

Yes! But be careful:
- Prefer wide-leg or palazzo
- Tight pants restrict leg movement
- Pair with an elegant blouse
