Your first milonga is approaching and you can't contain your excitement! Excitement, fear, curiosity all mixed together... This is completely normal. Everyone felt the same at their first milonga. This guide was created to help you make the most of that night.

<GamzeQuote>
Your first milonga is one of the most special moments in your tango journey. Don't stress, enjoy it. Everyone was a "first-timer" once.
</GamzeQuote>

## Before Going to the Milonga

### When Are You Ready?

You don't need to be a professional to go to a milonga! You're ready if you can:

- ✅ Basic walk (caminata)
- ✅ Abrazo (embrace) position
- ✅ One or two simple figures
- ✅ Dance for 3-4 minutes

<Callout type="tip" title="Tip from Gamze">
I usually recommend going to a milonga after 2-3 months of lessons. But if your instructor says "You're ready," you can go sooner.

### Which Milonga to Choose?

| Milonga Type | For First Time |
|--------------|----------------|
| Practica Milonga | ⭐⭐⭐ Ideal |
| Beginner-friendly | ⭐⭐⭐ Very good |
| Regular milonga | ⭐⭐ Good |
| Traditional milonga | ⭐ Can be challenging |

### Who to Go With?

- **With your instructor:** Safest choice
- **With classmates:** Familiar faces
- **With an experienced friend:** Provides guidance
- **Alone:** Takes courage but doable

Rubber-soled sneakers damage the floor and you can't pivot. Choose dance shoes or leather-soled shoes.

## Arriving at the Milonga

### When to Go?

| Time | Situation |
|------|-----------|
| Opening time | Very empty, but good for meeting people |
| 1 hour after opening | Ideal |
| 2+ hours after opening | Crowded, difficult |

### First 30 Minutes

1. **Check in:** Pay the fee, say hello
2. **Find a table:** Somewhere with a view of the floor
3. **Change shoes:** Put on your dance shoes
4. **Observe:** Just watch for the first 15-20 minutes
5. **Get a drink:** Order something

<Callout type="info" title="Table Selection">
Choose a table where you can see the floor and others can see you. Don't hide in a corner!
</Callout>

## Starting to Dance

### Your First Dance

**Start with someone you know:**
- Your classmate
- Your instructor
- Someone who offered to help

**During your first tanda:**
- Don't try to be perfect
- Focus on basic walking
- Listen to the music
- Trust your partner

### Trying Cabeceo

Cabeceo can be difficult at your first milonga:
- You can use verbal invitation with people you know
- Trying cabeceo with a stranger takes courage
- If rejected, it's okay - that's normal!

### If You're Not Dancing

**Don't worry!** It's normal to dance little at your first milonga.

**What you can do:**
- Listen to the music, try to recognize orchestras
- Watch good dancers
- Meet people, chat
- Listen to the DJ, learn tanda structure

## Expectation Management

### Realistic Expectations

| Everyone will watch me | No one is paying attention |

### Possible Challenges

1. **Few dances** - Normal, don't give up
2. **Making mistakes** - Everyone does
3. **Embarrassment** - Temporary, smile
4. **Fatigue** - Take breaks
5. **Loneliness** - Meet people, talk

| Giving up | Keep going, every milonga gets better |

## After Your First Milonga

### Evaluate Yourself

- How many tandas did I dance?
- What went well?
- What was challenging?
- What will I do differently next time?

<Callout type="tip" title="Remember">
Your first milonga is just the beginning. Each one gets better. Be patient with yourself and keep dancing!
