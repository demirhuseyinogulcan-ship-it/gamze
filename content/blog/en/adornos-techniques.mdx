Adornos (embellishments) are one of the most elegant elements of tango. They're a way to interpret the music and add your personal expression to the dance. In this guide, I'll explain the basic adornos techniques and when to use them.

<GamzeQuote>
Adornos are not led by the leader - they are your response to the music and the moment. This is one of the rare moments in tango where the woman has her own voice.
</GamzeQuote>

## What Are Adornos?

<TangoTerm
  term="Adornos"
  pronunciation="a-DOR-nos"
  definition="Embellishments. Personal movements the follower adds to basic steps."
/>

### When to Do Them?
- When the leader pauses or waits
- During musical accents
- Between turns and pauses
- **Never** disrupting the leader's guidance

<Callout type="warning" title="Golden Rule">
Adornos are done while maintaining connection first. An embellishment that breaks communication with your partner is not a good embellishment.
</Callout>

## Basic Adornos Techniques

### 1. Lápiz (Pencil)

<TangoTerm
  term="Lápiz"
  pronunciation="LA-pis"
  definition="Drawing lines or shapes on the floor with the toe."
/>

**How to do it:**
1. Weight on one foot
2. Draw circles or lines on the floor with the free foot's toe
3. Start small, keep it elegant

**When:**
- During pauses
- When the leader pivots
- Before ochos

### 2. Golpe (Tap)

<TangoTerm
  term="Golpe"
  pronunciation="GOL-pe"
  definition="Light, rhythmic tap on the floor with the foot."
/>

**How to do it:**
1. Lightly tap the floor with the sole of your free foot
2. Can be single or double
3. Synchronize with musical accents

**When:**
- Strong musical accent moments
- End of phrases
- Where rhythmic emphasis is needed

<Callout type="tip" title="Tip">
Golpe shouldn't be too loud. A gentle "tick" sound is enough. Don't yell at the floor in a milonga!
</Callout>

### 3. Caricia (Caress)

<TangoTerm
  term="Caricia"
  pronunciation="ka-RI-sia"
  definition="The foot caressing partner's leg or your own leg."
/>

**Types:**
- **To partner**: Caressing their leg with the inside of your foot
- **Self**: Caressing your own calf

**When:**
- In close embrace positions
- During slow music
- In emotional moments

### 4. Boleo

<TangoTerm
  term="Boleo"
  pronunciation="bo-LE-o"
  definition="Whipping movement of the free leg, usually following a sudden direction change."
/>

**Types:**
- **Low boleo**: Leg stays close to ground
- **High boleo**: Leg goes up (only in shows!)

<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
High boleos are DANGEROUS in milongas. You could kick someone! Keep boleos low in social dancing.
</Callout>

### 5. Gancho

<TangoTerm
  term="Gancho"
  pronunciation="GAN-cho"
  definition="Hook. Wrapping your leg around partner's leg."
/>

**How:**
1. Usually led, but can be adorned
2. Use the inside of your leg
3. Keep it controlled

## Tips for Practice

### Start Simple
- Master one technique at a time
- Practice with slow music first
- Build muscle memory

### Music First
- Listen to the music
- Find the right moments
- Don't force adornos where they don't fit

### Mirror Practice
- Watch yourself
- Check your posture
- Ensure elegance, not just movement

<GamzeQuote>
The best adornos are the ones that look effortless. When you have to think about them, they're not ready yet.
</GamzeQuote>

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too many adornos**: Less is more
2. **Wrong timing**: Listen to the music
3. **Breaking connection**: Partner first, adornos second
4. **Too big**: Keep it subtle in social dancing
5. **Tension**: Stay relaxed

## Recommended Learning Path

1. **Week 1-2**: Lápiz variations
2. **Week 3-4**: Golpe and timing
3. **Week 5-6**: Caricia techniques
4. **Week 7-8**: Low boleo (carefully!)
5. **Month 3+**: Combining techniques

<Callout type="tip" title="Practice Tip">
Film yourself dancing. Watch where you naturally pause - those are your adornos opportunities.
</Callout>
