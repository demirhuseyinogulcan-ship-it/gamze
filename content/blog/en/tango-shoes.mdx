In tango, the shoe is one of the most important equipment choices. The right shoe improves your balance, protects your knees, and transforms your technique. In this guide, I'll share everything you need to know about tango shoes.

You can dance tango in socks, but you cannot experience tango. The right shoe is not a luxury—it's a necessity.
</GamzeQuote>

## Why Tango Shoes?

Regular shoes don't work for tango because:

- **Street shoes**: Too much grip, can't pivot
- **Running shoes**: Too soft, no support
- **Flip flops**: Dangerous, no control
- **Ballet shoes**: Not enough structure

### What Tango Shoes Provide

✅ **Suede sole**: Perfect grip/slip balance
✅ **Heel support**: Better posture
✅ **Flexibility**: Foot articulation
✅ **Durability**: Made for dancing

## Women's Tango Shoes

### Heel Heights

<Callout type="info" title="Measurement">
Heel height is measured from the back of the heel to the ground, not including the platform (if any).
</Callout>

**Low heel (5-6 cm / 2-2.5")**
- Best for: Beginners, those with balance issues
- Pros: Stable, comfortable, less strain
- Cons: Less "tango aesthetic"

**Medium heel (7-8 cm / 2.75-3.25")**
- Best for: Intermediate dancers
- Pros: Good balance of style and stability
- Cons: Takes adjustment

**High heel (9-10 cm / 3.5-4")**
- Best for: Advanced dancers
- Pros: Beautiful lines, traditional look
- Cons: Requires excellent balance

<GamzeQuote>
Start lower than you think. I've seen too many beginners buy 9cm heels and spend months struggling before switching to 7cm and suddenly improving.

**Cons:**

- Must be kept dry

<Callout type="warning" title="Care">
Never wear suede soles outside! One walk on wet pavement ruins them. Always bring shoes to the venue and change there.
</Callout>

### Leather Soles

**Pros:**

## Sizing Guide

<Callout type="tip" title="Important">
Tango shoe sizes often differ from regular shoe sizes. Always try before buying, or order from sites with good return policies.
</Callout>

### Fitting Tips

1. **Try in evening**: Feet swell during the day
2. **Bring tango socks**: Or the ones you'll dance in
3. **Stand on one foot**: Test balance
4. **Do a pivot**: Test slip/grip
5. **Walk around**: Check comfort

### Signs of Good Fit
