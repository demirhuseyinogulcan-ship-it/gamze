## The Golden Age of Tango

The **Época de Oro** (Golden Age) spans roughly **1935-1955**. This is the music most milongas play and most tango dancers learn to.

### Why the Golden Age?

- Perfect balance of structure and emotion
- Clear rhythm for dancing
- Recording quality improved
- Greatest orchestras active simultaneously

### Before the Golden Age (Guardia Vieja)

- **1900-1935**: "Old Guard"
- Simpler arrangements
- Less common at milongas
- Historical interest

### After the Golden Age (Nuevo Tango)

- **1955 onwards**: More experimental
- Piazzolla and followers
- Concert music (not always danceable)
- Alternative milongas play this

## Understanding Tango Structure

Every tango has:

### The Compás (Beat)

Tango is in **4/4 time** (4 beats per measure)

- Count: 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4
