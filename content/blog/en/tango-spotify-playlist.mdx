### Create Your Own Playlist

#### Step 1: Starting Songs

Start with our [Best 50 Tango Songs](/en/blog/best-tango-songs) list.

#### Step 2: Tanda Format

To create a playlist like professional milonga DJs:

```
4 Tango (same orchestra)
1 Cortina (30 sec different music)
4 Tango (different orchestra)
1 Cortina
4 Vals (mixed orchestra)
1 Cortina
3 Milonga (mixed orchestra)
1 Cortina
... repeat
```

#### Step 3: Energy Wave

Organize your playlist in a "wave" shape:

```
Medium energy → High → Romantic → High → Medium
```

This provides ideal flow for a 2-3 hour milonga.
