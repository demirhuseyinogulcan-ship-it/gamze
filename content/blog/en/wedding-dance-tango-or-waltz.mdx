Your wedding date is approaching. Invitations printed, venue booked, wedding dress fitting done. The sweetest (or for some, the most stressful!) detail remains: **The First Dance.**

Most couples who come to my studio face the same indecision: *"Teacher, should we do a waltz or a tango?"*

There is no single right answer to this question. Because every couple's energy, every love story is different. Let's put these two magnificent dances on the table and find "your" dance.

## Classic and Noble: Waltz

Waltz is the indispensable classic of weddings. The phrase "feeling like a princess" is exactly for the waltz.

**Why Choose Waltz?**
*   **The Wedding Dress Factor:** If you are going to wear a very fluffy, princess-style wedding dress, the swaying of your skirt during waltz turns looks fascinating.
*   **Easy to Learn:** Basic steps (box step) are relatively simple. You can achieve an elegant look in a short time.
*   **Music:** If Andre Rieu classics or movie soundtracks (like La La Land) appeal to you, waltz is the right choice.

**Disadvantage:** It is a bit of a "safe" harbor. Seen at every wedding, the surprise effect is low.

## Passionate and Impressive: Tango

Tango... It is the dance of brave couples. The choice of those who say "We don't want to be ordinary".

**Why Choose Tango?**
*   **Show Effect:** Tango's stances, sudden turns, and those famous "poses" fascinate your guests. Applause is guaranteed! 👏
*   **Emotionally Charged:** It is the best way to reflect the passion of your love on stage. Eye to eye, breath to breath...
*   **Music Variety:** You can dance not only to classic tango but also to legendary tracks known by everyone like "Por Una Cabeza" (Scent of a Woman music).

**Difficulty Level:** It requires a little more practice than waltz, but as Gamze Tango, we prepare simplified but cool choreographies suitable for your level in our **wedding dance packages**.

<Callout type="info" title="Advice from Gamze">
Do you want to do tango but are afraid "it will be too hard"? Consider the **"Tango Waltz"** option! It acts as a wonderful genre combining the fluidity of waltz with the figures of tango.

## Decision Guide

Still not sure? Answer these questions:

1.  **Your Wedding Venue:** Is it a historic mansion (Waltz), a modern hotel, or a country wedding (Tango)?
2.  **Your Shoes:** If you are wearing very high heels, waltz might be safer. Tango requires a bit more balance (but you can change shoes!).
3.  **Your Personality:** Are you "romantic and calm" or "energetic and assertive"?

## How Long Before Should We Start?

Whether tango or waltz, **don't leave it to the last week!**
*   **Ideal Time:** Start 1.5 - 2 months before. (6-8 lessons)
*   **Minimum Time:** 3 weeks.
*   **Emergency:** If you say "Teacher, my wedding is next week!", we prepare you for the stage with an accelerated 2-3 lesson "rescue package".

### Wedding Dance Preparation in Istanbul and Silivri

I give wedding dance lessons on both sides of Istanbul (Kadıköy, Beyoğlu) and in Silivri. We do our rehearsals in the studio environment, but if you wish, we can do the last lesson (if possible) at your wedding venue and take a "floor rehearsal".

Remember, that 3-minute dance will remain the most beautiful memory in the videos you will watch for a lifetime.
