Deciding which song to choose for your wedding dance can be difficult. In this article, I'll share the most popular wedding dance tangos and selection criteria.

<GamzeQuote>
Song selection comes before choreography. The music inspires you, the movement follows the music - not the other way around.
</GamzeQuote>

## Song Selection Criteria

### 1. Duration
- **Ideal**: 2:30 - 3:30 minutes

Long songs can be professionally shortened. Ask your DJ or audio engineer for this.

### 2. Tempo
- **Slow**: For dramatic, emotional moments
- **Medium**: Easiest to execute
- **Fast**: Gives energy but is difficult

### 3. Meaning
- Song lyrics should mean something to you
- Love, passion, new beginnings themes are suitable
- Avoid sad lyrics

### 4. Recognition
- Well-known songs impress guests
- But you can avoid clichéd pieces
- Find the balance

## Alternative Choices

### Modern Songs in Tango Style

Not all wedding dances need traditional tango music. Some couples choose:

- **Ed Sheeran - Perfect** (slow dance with tango elements)
- **Leonard Cohen - Dance Me to the End of Love**
- **Roxanne - from Moulin Rouge** (dramatic!)

<Callout type="tip" title="Personalization">
If you have "your song" that isn't tango, we can create a choreography that incorporates tango elements into any music style.
</Callout>

## How to Make the Final Decision

### Step 1: Create a Shortlist
- Listen to 10-15 songs
- Note which ones make you feel something
- Narrow down to 3-5 favorites

### Step 2: Test with Movement
- Play each song while standing together
- Does it make you want to move?
- Can you imagine dancing to it?

### Step 3: Consider Your Story
- Which song fits your relationship?
- What mood do you want to create?
- What will guests remember?

### Step 4: Technical Check
- Is the length appropriate?
- Is the tempo danceable for your level?
- Can it be edited if needed?

## Working with Your Instructor

When you come to lessons:

1. **Bring your top 3 choices**
2. **Be open to suggestions**
3. **Try dancing to each**
4. **Trust the process**

<GamzeQuote>
Sometimes couples come in 100% sure of their song, and leave choosing something completely different - and loving it even more.
</GamzeQuote>

## Editing Your Song

Most songs need some editing for wedding dances:

- **Shortening**: Remove repeated sections
- **Intro adjustment**: Start from the right moment
- **Fade out**: End gracefully
- **Combining**: Rare, but possible

<Callout type="warning" title="Professional Editing">
Don't try to edit the song yourself unless you know audio editing. Bad edits are very noticeable. Budget $50-100 for professional editing.
</Callout>

## Final Checklist

Before finalizing your song:

✅ Both partners love it
✅ Length is appropriate (or will be edited)
✅ Tempo matches your skill level
✅ You've practiced dancing to it
✅ It tells your story
✅ You have a high-quality audio file
