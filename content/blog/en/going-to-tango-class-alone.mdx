The timid question I hear most often when I answer the phone in my studio is:

*"Hello, Ms. Gamze... I want to learn tango but... Um, I don't have a partner. Can I still come?"*

My answer is always clear and loud: **YES! ABSOLUTELY!**

Let me even tell you a secret: 70% of my students who are creating wonders in my classes in Silivri and Istanbul Kadıköy right now walked through that door alone.

Tango is a "two-person" dance, but the tango journey starts "individually". Let me explain why you should go to a tango course even if you don't have a partner (or even especially if you don't).

## 1. We Do "Partner Rotation" in Classes 🔄

The golden rule of tango education: **Everyone dances with everyone.**

Here is how I set up the system in my lessons: While practicing a move, every 3-5 minutes I say "Come on, changing partners!".

This has 2 enormous benefits for you:
1.  **You Learn Better:** If you only get used to your own partner, you also memorize their mistakes. Dancing with different people teaches "real" tango, that is, leading and following.
2.  **No One Waits in the Corner:** The fear of "Oh, I came alone, will I be a wallflower?" does not exist with us. Everyone is part of the dance circle.

## 2. The Most Natural Way to Socialize 🤝

We are lonely in the crowds of Istanbul, I know. From work to home, home to work... Meeting new people is hard.

Tango course is the most enjoyable way to break this chain. Here, doctors, engineers, students, retirees are side by side. Our common ground is dance.
If you don't have a partner, this is a wonderful environment to build **new friendships** (and yes, sometimes new loves 🥰).

For example, our tea chats after lessons in our Silivri studio are famous.

## 3. "But What If the Number of Men/Women in Class Isn't Equal?" ⚖️

As a professional instructor (that's me), this is the issue I pay the most attention to. When taking registrations, I observe the **gender balance**.

What do we do if there is an imbalance in the class?
*   Our assistants step in.
*   Our experienced students from upper classes (taxi dancers) join the lesson and provide support.
*   I guarantee no one is left idle.

## 4. Meet Yourself

Coming without a partner is actually an investment you make in yourself. You take a step according to your own schedule, for your own happiness, without having to say "let's go" to anyone. This self-confidence reflects on your dance too.

<Callout type="success" title="Dare!">
Every day you postpone because you don't have a partner is a day spent without dance. And believe me, days without dance are very boring!

Remember, there is no "I" in tango, there is "we". You don't need to bring a partner to be a part of that "we".
