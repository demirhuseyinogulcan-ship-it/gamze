Greetings! 💃

I know very well that "sweet rush" in one's mind when starting a new hobby. You signed up for a tango lesson, excitement is at its peak, but you are thinking deeply in front of the wardrobe: *"I wonder what I should wear?"*

*   "Will I look too fancy?"
*   "Is it rude if I go in sweatpants?"
*   "Do I have to wear high heels?"

Let me put you at ease right away: **We are not on a tango runway, we are coming to learn!** 😊

I always tell my students coming to my studio in Silivri or my classes in Istanbul Kadıköy: **"Anything you feel comfortable in is the most correct tango outfit."**

Still, just so you don't have any question marks in your mind, let's examine this issue separately for women and men.

## What to Wear to the First Lesson?

Remember, we won't be doing complex figures in the first lessons. We will walk, stop, transfer weight. So, choosing clothes that do not restrict your mobility is sufficient.

### Suggestions for Women 👗

*   **Bottom:** Comfortable dress pants, leggings, or a skirt that is not too tight would be great. Avoid long and tight skirts, they prevent you from taking steps. If you say "I am a skirt person", models with slits or pleats are life-savers.
*   **Top:** Cotton t-shirts or blouses that don't make you sweat. You can prefer a cardigan instead of jackets that restrict arms too much. You can take it off as you warm up.
*   **Avoid:** Very short mini skirts (you can't move comfortably) and strapless blouses (they might slip while embracing, you'll be uncomfortable).

### Suggestions for Men 👕

*   **Bottom:** Linen pants, canvas pants, or comfortable jeans. Just stay away from very tight "skinny" models or very loose shalwar-type pants. It is important for your instructor (me) to see your steps.
*   **Top:** Shirt, polo neck t-shirt, or plain t-shirt. Bringing a spare t-shirt with you would be a super move out of respect for your partner. 😉
*   **Avoid:** Tracksuits (might be a bit too sporty, tango is an elegant dance after all) and very thick sweaters.

## The Most Important Topic: Shoe Choice 👠👞

"Teacher, do I need to buy those expensive tango shoes right away?"

**NO!** At least not for the first 1-2 months.

### Shoes for Women
It is important to find your balance in the first lessons. Therefore:
*   **Recommended:** A shoe that grips the ankle, flat or low-heeled, but with a leather (slippery) sole.
*   **Alternative:** You can even dance with thick socks! (In fact, sometimes I make students practice with socks to understand the feeling of the floor).
*   **Stay Away From:** Sneakers (soles grip the floor too much, you can't turn), slippers, boots, or platform heels (cut your contact with the ground).

### Shoes for Men
*   **Recommended:** Classic shoes with leather soles or comfortable walking shoes that don't grip the floor too much.
*   **Stay Away From:** Sports shoes that "vacuum" the floor like basketball shoes and heavy boots.

## In the Future...

Once the tango virus enters your blood (which it will, don't say I didn't warn you!), you will already want to buy those sparkling, wonderful heels and stylish men's shoes. Then I will direct you to the best tango shoemakers in Istanbul. There are wonderful workshops in Beyoğlu and Taksim areas.

Keeping a small towel, deodorant, and mints with you when coming to class are the golden rules of "social tango etiquette".

## In Summary:

Be comfortable, be clean, be yourself. At Gamze Tango, we look at the sparkle in your eyes, not your outfit.
