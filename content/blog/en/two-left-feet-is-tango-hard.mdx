Hello! I'm Gamze. 👋

I have been a tango instructor for years, and I have met countless students who walked through the door of my studio with a shy, slightly embarrassed expression and said this sentence:

**"Teacher, I really want to, but... I have two left feet!"**

Or:
- "I have zero sense of rhythm."
- "I'm as stiff as a board."
- "I've never even danced at a wedding."

If you are reading these lines right now and saying "Oh, that's me!", I have great news for you: **You are not alone, and most importantly, you are wrong.** 😊

## Tango is Not a "Talent" Business, It's a "Communication" Business

From the outside, tango may look like complex footwork, fast turns, and acrobatic figures. But that's not the essence of it.

Tango begins with the **embrace** (abrazo) of two people. And believe me, you don't need any special talent to hug. The silent communication you establish with your partner is much more valuable than the step you take.

### Why is There a Perception That "Tango is Hard"?

Because in movies, we always watched "show" tango (Tango Escenario). Legs flying in the air, stern looks, roses... However, social tango (Tango de Salon) is entirely based on **comfort, enjoyment, and naturalness**.

<Callout type="info" title="True Story">
A gentleman in his 50s who came to my studio in Silivri last year started by saying, "I can't even walk properly." 3 months later, he wouldn't leave the dance floor at a milonga (tango night) in Beyoğlu! Do you know what his secret was? He just learned to **walk**. Because tango consists of walking in harmony with the music.

## We Are Debunking the "Two Left Feet" Myth

Let's address your concerns one by one:

### 1. "I Have No Ear for Rhythm"
Tango music is like your heartbeat. You don't need to count 1-2-3-4. Just listen to the music. Before the lesson, we will train your ear by listening to the tracks I recommend (like Carlos Di Sarli, D'Arienzo). Over time, that rhythm will embed itself in your body.

### 2. "I Don't Have a Partner"
No problem at all! Half of those who attend our classes in Istanbul, Kadıköy, or my own place in Silivri come alone. We constantly rotate pairs during lessons to ensure everyone dances with each other. In fact, this way you socialize and make new friends.

### 3. "What If I Make a Mistake?"
There are no mistakes in tango, only "new steps"! 😉 As long as you don't crash into someone, stepping wrong doesn't matter at all. Tango is improvisation; whatever you feel in that moment is the right thing.

## How Can You Start?

Don't make it a big deal in your head. We won't run a marathon, we'll just dance.

1.  **Wear Comfortable Clothes:** No need for a special costume or tango shoes for the first lesson. Pants you can move comfortably in and clean-soled shoes are enough.
2.  **Leave Your Prejudices at the Door:** It is forbidden to bring the word "I can't" into the studio!
3.  **Give Yourself Time:** Don't expect to dance like an Argentinean in the first lesson. Enjoy the process.

### Tango in Silivri and Istanbul

The hustle and bustle of Istanbul, traffic, stress... Sometimes one just wants to stop and breathe. Tango is a 3-minute oasis (the duration of a song) you create for yourself in the middle of this chaos.

Whether after work in Kadıköy or on the weekend in Silivri... Wherever you are, tango will be good for you.
