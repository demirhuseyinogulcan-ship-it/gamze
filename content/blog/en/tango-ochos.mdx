Ocho - "eight" in Spanish - is one of tango's most elegant and iconic figures. This movement, which looks like the follower drawing the number eight on the floor, is one of tango's fundamental building blocks.

<GamzeQuote>
Ocho is tango's poetry. Feet write poetry on the floor, body feels the music.
