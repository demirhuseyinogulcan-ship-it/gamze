"What is tango?" This is the first question every new student asks. The short answer: Tango is a dance where two people embrace and move with the music. But the real answer is much deeper...

<GamzeQuote>
Tango is the art of expressing with the body what cannot be said with words.

## The Origins of Tango

### The Neighborhoods of Buenos Aires

In the late 19th century, immigrants from all over the world came to Buenos Aires. Italians, Spaniards, Germans, Poles, and people of African descent...

These people:
- Brought their own music
- Carried their dance traditions
- Created a new culture in a new city

And from this mixture, **tango** was born.

<Callout type="info" title="Historical Note">
The origin of the word "tango" is debated. Some claim it comes from African languages, others argue it derives from the Spanish word "tangir" (to touch).

## Why is Tango Special?

### 1. Connection (Conexión)

In tango, two partners become one under the guidance of music. This connection is not just physical but an emotional bridge.

### 2. Improvisation

Tango is not choreography. Every dance is created in the moment. The leader proposes, the follower responds.

### 3. Music

Tango music is the soul of the dance. D'Arienzo's rhythm, Pugliese's dramatic interpretation, Di Sarli's elegance...
