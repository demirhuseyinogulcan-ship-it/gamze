Hello! I'm Gamze, and today we're embarking on a journey into the magical world of tango. I've been teaching tango for over 10 years, and with each new student, I rediscover my love for this dance.

Tango is not just a dance, it's a way of life. Two people trusting each other, becoming one with the rhythm of the music...

## What is Tango?

Tango is a partner dance that originated in the late 19th century in the neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, where two people embrace (abrazo) and dance together. But calling it just a dance would be an injustice - tango is a philosophy, a language of communication, a way of life.

<TangoTerm
  term="Abrazo"
  pronunciation="ab-RA-so"
  definition="The tango embrace. How two partners hold each other. The most fundamental and important element of tango."
/>

### The History of Tango

Tango was born in the La Boca, San Telmo, and Barracas neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, where immigrants from around the world gathered. Italian, Spanish, African-origin music and dances combined to create this unique art form.

Tango was added to UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2009. This is official recognition of tango's cultural value worldwide.

## Basic Elements of Tango

### 1. Abrazo (Embrace)

Tango begins with the abrazo. Two partners trusting and embracing each other forms the foundation of tango. You can choose open (abierto) or closed (cerrado) embrace.

### 2. Caminata (Walk)

<TangoTerm
  term="Caminata"
  pronunciation="ka-mi-NA-ta"
  definition="The tango walk. The most fundamental movement of tango. A good caminata is the foundation of good tango."
/>

Though it looks simple, the tango walk requires mastery. Weight transfer, maintaining balance, and harmony with your partner are crucial.

### 3. Ocho (Eight)

The movement where the woman traces a figure eight. Can be done forward (adelante) or backward (atras).

### 4. Giro (Turn)

The movement where partners turn around each other.

<Callout type="tip" title="Tip from Gamze">
Focus on the basic walk (caminata) at first. A proper walk is the foundation of all figures. Don't rush - tango requires patience!

## Milonga: The Tango Party

<TangoTerm
  term="Milonga"
  pronunciation="mi-LON-ga"
  definition="A tango party or event. Also refers to a faster, more playful style of tango."
/>

A milonga is a social event where tango dancers gather. Here are some important rules:

- **Cabeceo**: Dance invitation through eye contact
- **Tanda**: A set of 3-4 songs for dancing
- **Cortina**: Music between tandas
