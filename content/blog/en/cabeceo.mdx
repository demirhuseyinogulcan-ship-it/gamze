At the milonga, a man passes by your table and looks at you. You look back at him. He slightly nods his head. You smile. And there it is, the dance invitation is complete! This is **cabeceo** - tango's most elegant and subtle tradition.

<GamzeQuote>
Cabeceo provides freedom for both the inviter and the invited. No one feels rejected, no one feels obligated.
</GamzeQuote>

## What Is Cabeceo?

<TangoTerm
  term="Cabeceo"
  pronunciation="ka-be-SE-o"
  definition="Dance invitation made through eye contact and head movement. Comes from the Spanish word 'cabeza' (head)."
/>

### Why Cabeceo?

1. **Privacy:** Rejecting isn't embarrassing
2. **Freedom:** No one has to accept reluctantly
3. **Elegance:** Wordless, subtle communication
4. **Tradition:** 100+ years of tango culture

## How to Do Cabeceo?

### For Men (Leaders)

#### Step 1: Observation
- Scan the room before the tanda starts
- Identify who you want to dance with
- Gauge if they also want to dance

#### Step 2: Eye Contact
- Make eye contact from a distance
- Don't look away from them
- Be patient - they might not look immediately

#### Step 3: Head Movement
- When eye contact is established, slightly nod your head
- Or slightly raise your eyebrows
- Don't exaggerate, a small movement is enough

#### Step 4: Confirmation
- If they nod back or smile: YES
- If they turn away or stop looking: NO

#### Step 5: Approach
- After getting confirmation, go to their table
- Extend your hand
- Walk to the floor together

<Callout type="warning" title="Note">
Going to a table and asking "Would you like to dance?" without eye contact is not cabeceo and is considered rude in some milongas.
</Callout>

### For Women (Followers)

#### Be Visible
- Sit where you can see the floor
- Don't get absorbed in conversation with friends
- Don't look at your phone
- Show that you want to dance

#### Eye Contact Response

| Situation | What to Do |
|-----------|------------|
| I want to dance | Maintain eye contact, smile slightly |
| Not sure | Brief eye contact, then look away |
| Don't want to dance | Turn your head, look elsewhere |

#### Giving Confirmation
- Nod your head slightly
- Smile
- Prepare to stand up

<Callout type="tip" title="Tip">
If someone you don't want to dance with is looking at you, just look elsewhere. This isn't rude, it's a normal response.
</Callout>

## Cabeceo Tips

### Light and Distance

- Cabeceo is difficult in dim light
- Hard to see from too far
- Ideal distance: 5-15 meters

### Timing

- Just before the tanda starts
- During cortina (for new tanda)
- Not in the middle of a song!

### Failed Cabeceo

Sometimes misunderstandings happen:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Wrong person stood up | Politely explain or dance anyway |
| No one is looking | Move to a different position |
| Two people at once | Give clearer signals |
