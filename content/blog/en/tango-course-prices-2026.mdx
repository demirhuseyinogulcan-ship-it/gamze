You decided to learn tango, watched videos, you are excited. But you have that realistic question in mind:

*"So what is the cost of this? Is tango an expensive hobby?"*

As we enter 2026, I would like to talk about tango course prices in Istanbul in general and Silivri in particular, options, and the advantages we offer you as **Gamze Tango**.

First of all, let me say this: **Tango is an accessible luxury that more than pays back the investment you make in your soul.**

## How Do Prices Vary?

When taking tango education, you usually encounter two main options and prices are determined accordingly:

### 1. Group Lessons (Economical and Social) 👥
Group lessons are the most budget-friendly way to start tango.
*   **Advantage:** Both more affordable and provides a social environment.
*   **Price Range:** In the Istanbul (Kadıköy, Taksim) market, monthly packages are usually offered as 1 or 2 days a week. In our lessons in Silivri, I take care to set **more accessible** figures by considering local dynamics.

### 2. Private Lessons (Fast and Focused) 🚀
These are lessons where you work one-on-one with the instructor (or as a couple with your partner).
*   **Advantage:** 100% focus on you, you progress much faster. The time and day fit you.
*   **Pricing:** Determine per hourly rate. Serious discounts are applied for 5 or 10 package purchases.

<Callout type="info" title="Did You Know?">
Our group lessons are not just "come to class and go". With the "Practice Hours" we gift alongside, even if you take lessons one day a week, you can use the studio on other days and reinforce what you learned. This ensures you get many times the return on the fee you pay.

## 2026 Current Market Situation

In 2026, increases in studio rents and general expenses were reflected in prices across the sector. However, as an instructor, my priority is for art to remain accessible.

*   **Istanbul Average:** In central districts of Istanbul (Beyoğlu, Şişli), prices can vary considerably depending on the location of the studio and the recognition of the instructor.
*   **Gamze Tango Approach:** I act with the motto **"art is for everyone"** in both my Silivri and Istanbul lessons. My goal is for you to be able to add this passion to your life without shaking your budget.

### Packages Special for You

Everyone's need is different. That's why instead of putting a single price list and saying "follow this", I offer solutions tailored to your needs:

*   **Starter Package:** For those who say "Let me try, I'll continue if I like it".
*   **Wedding Dance Package:** Special for couples, covering everything including choreography and music.
*   **Student Discount:** I always make positive discrimination for my student friends! 🎓

## How to Find Out the Correct Price?

I don't like writing "huge numbers" on the website because tango is not a fabricated job. I need to know your level, your goal (hobby? professional? wedding?).

Maybe what suits you best are our seasonal **campaign packages**?
