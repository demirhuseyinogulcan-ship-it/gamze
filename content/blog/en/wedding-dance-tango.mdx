Imagine this: the lights dim, your favorite tango begins, and all eyes are on you and your partner. For the next three minutes, you tell your love story through dance. That's the magic of a tango wedding dance.

<GamzeQuote>
Tango isn't just a dance choice - it's a statement. It says you're passionate, elegant, and not afraid to do something different.
</GamzeQuote>

## Why Choose Tango?

### It's Unforgettable
- Guests have seen the swaying waltz hundreds of times
- Tango stands out and stays in memory
- It creates that "wow" moment

### It's Meaningful
- Tango is about connection and communication
- It represents partnership and trust
- Perfect metaphor for marriage

### It's Achievable
- You don't need to be dancers
- 6-8 weeks is enough for a beautiful routine
- Simplified choreography looks impressive

## Timeline: When to Start

| Time Before Wedding | What to Do |
|---------------------|------------|
| 3-4 months | Start lessons, choose music |
| 2 months | Learn choreography |
| 1 month | Polish and practice |
| 2 weeks | Dress rehearsal with outfit |
| 1 week | Run-through at venue if possible |

<Callout type="warning" title="Don't Wait!">
Starting too late is the #1 regret couples have. Give yourself enough time to feel confident, not stressed.
</Callout>

## Choosing Your Music

### Classic Choices
- **Por Una Cabeza** - Most popular, medium tempo
- **Libertango** - Modern, energetic
- **La Cumparsita** - Traditional, well-known
- **El Día Que Me Quieras** - Romantic, slower

### Considerations
- Length: 2:30-3:30 is ideal
- Tempo: Match your skill level
- Meaning: Lyrics that resonate
- Recognition: Guests will enjoy familiar music

<Callout type="tip" title="Music Editing">
Long songs can be professionally edited. Your DJ or a sound engineer can create a custom version.

## What You'll Learn

### Basic Framework
1. **The Entrance**: How you walk onto the floor
2. **Opening**: First connection, first steps
3. **Middle**: The main choreography
4. **Highlight**: One or two "wow" moments
5. **Ending**: A memorable finish

### Typical Moves
- Walking together (elegant and connected)
- Simple ochos
- Controlled turns
- Perhaps a small dip or dramatic pause
- **Not**: Crazy lifts or dangerous kicks

<GamzeQuote>
The goal isn't to look like professionals. It's to look like two people deeply in love, moving together.

## Private vs. Group Lessons

### Private Lessons ✓
- **Best for**: Wedding prep
- Choreography designed for you
- Works with your song
- Addresses your specific challenges
- Flexible scheduling

### Group Lessons
- Good for basics
- Less personalized
- Not for choreography

## What to Expect

### First Lesson
- Assess your movement comfort
- Start with walking and embrace
- Listen to music options
- Set realistic goals

### Middle Lessons
- Learn the choreography
- Build muscle memory
- Add personality

### Final Lessons
- Polish transitions
- Practice with music
- Rehearse with outfit

## Common Challenges

### "My partner has two left feet"
**Solution**: Simplified steps that look elegant. The leader's steps can be minimal.

### "We're nervous performers"
**Solution**: Practice creates confidence. We also teach performance mindset.

### "Our venue floor is tricky"
**Solution**: We discuss floor types and adjust footwear accordingly.

### "I'm wearing a big dress"
**Solution**: Choreography considers your outfit. Practice in similar clothes.

## Outfit Considerations

### For the Bride
- Test your dress mobility
- Consider train management
- Heel height matters
- Practice in your actual shoes

### For the Groom
- Ensure jacket allows arm movement
- Comfortable, leather-soled shoes
- Practice in similar pants

<Callout type="info" title="Dress Rehearsal">
Schedule one lesson in your actual outfit 2 weeks before. You'll discover any issues with time to solve them.
</Callout>

## Day-Of Tips

### Before the Dance
- Take 5 minutes alone together
- Review the first 8 counts
- Breathe deeply
- Remember: Everyone is rooting for you

### During the Dance
- Look at each other, not the guests
- Smile (genuine, not forced)
- If you make a mistake, keep dancing
- Enjoy the moment

### If Something Goes Wrong
- Laugh together
- Keep moving
- No one knows the choreography but you
- Imperfection is charming
