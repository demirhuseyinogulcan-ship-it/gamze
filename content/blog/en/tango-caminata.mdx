Caminata - the tango walk - is the foundation of every figure. Buenos Aires' great maestros say: "The most important thing in tango is walking." If you perfect your walk, everything becomes easier.

<GamzeQuote>
20-year milongueros still practice caminata every day. Because the foundation of tango is walking, and perfection requires constant practice.

## What Is Caminata?

<TangoTerm term="Caminata" pronunciation="ka-mi-NA-ta" definition="Tango walk. The most basic and important movement pattern in tango." />

Caminata is not just going from point A to point B:
- **Controlled movement** - Every millimeter planned
- **Musical expression** - Harmony with rhythm
- **Partner connection** - Moving together
- **Elegant flow** - Seamless transitions

|-----------|-------------|
| Floor contact | Foot doesn't "lift," it slides |
| Weight transfer | Complete and clean |

## Walking Systems

### Parallel System

- Leader and follower use opposite feet

- Natural, basic system

### Cross System

- Leader and follower use same-side feet
- Leader left = Follower left

<TangoTerm term="Sistema cruzado" definition="Cross system. Partners moving with same-side feet." />

### Changing Systems

Change systems by taking a step without moving:
