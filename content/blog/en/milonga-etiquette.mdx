A milonga is a social event where tango dancers come together to dance. However, it has its own etiquette and unwritten rules (códigos). In this guide, you'll learn everything you need to know to feel confident at any milonga.

<GamzeQuote>
There's one thing at milongas that matters more than technique: respect. Respect for your partner, respect for the dance floor, respect for the music.
</GamzeQuote>

## What is a Milonga?

First, let's clear up the terminology:

- **Milonga** (event): A social tango dance night
- **Milonga** (music): A faster-tempo dance style within tango
- **Tanda**: A set of 3-4 songs played together
- **Cortina**: Short non-tango music between tandas

<Callout type="info" title="Terminology">
When someone says "See you at the milonga," they mean the event. When they say "This is a milonga rhythm," they mean the music style.
</Callout>

## The Invitation System

### Cabeceo: The Eye Contact Invitation

The traditional way to invite someone to dance:

1. **Make eye contact** across the room
2. **Nod slightly** or raise eyebrows
3. **Wait for acknowledgment** (smile, nod back)
4. **Walk to meet** your partner
5. **Escort** to the dance floor together

**Why this system?**
- Allows discrete refusal (just look away)
- No public embarrassment for either party
- Works across language barriers
- Maintains elegance of the tradition

<Callout type="tip" title="Positioning">
Sit where you can see and be seen. Corners and dark spots make cabeceo difficult.
</Callout>

### Direct Approach

In more casual milongas, especially outside Argentina:

- Walking up and asking "Would you like to dance?" is acceptable
- Still be respectful of a "no"
- Never pressure or insist
- "Maybe later" usually means no

## The Tanda Structure

Understanding tandas is essential:

### How Tandas Work

- **Tango tandas**: 3-4 songs, usually same orchestra
- **Vals tandas**: 3 songs (Viennese waltz rhythm)
- **Milonga tandas**: 3 songs (faster, playful rhythm)

### The Cortina

Between tandas, a "cortina" (curtain) plays:

- 30-60 seconds of non-tango music
- Signals the tanda is over
- Time to thank your partner
- Return to your seat
- Find your next partner

<GamzeQuote>
Never, ever leave your partner in the middle of a tanda. It's one of the most disrespectful things you can do.
</GamzeQuote>

## Dance Floor Navigation

### Line of Dance

Tango flows counter-clockwise around the floor:

- **Outer lane**: Experienced dancers, more movement
- **Center**: Beginners, or space for moves requiring room
- **Never** go against the flow
- **No passing** without good reason

### Avoiding Collisions

- Leader is responsible for navigation
- Keep your movements compact
- Be aware of surrounding couples
- If you bump someone: brief apology, keep dancing

<Callout type="warning" title="Safety First">
Dangerous moves (high boleos, ganchos) should only be done when you have clear space. On a crowded floor, keep everything low and controlled.
</Callout>

## Dress Code

### General Guidelines

**For women:**
- Elegant but comfortable
- Skirts that allow movement (or pants)
- Proper tango shoes or heels
- Hair secured (you'll be close to faces)

**For men:**
- Neat, clean clothing
- Button-up shirt common
- Comfortable dance shoes
- Fresh breath matters!

<Callout type="tip" title="Hygiene">
Tango is intimate. Shower before the milonga, use deodorant, brush teeth, carry mints. These aren't optional—they're essential courtesy.
</Callout>

### What to Bring

- **Shoes**: Bring your dance shoes, change there
- **Towel/tissues**: Dancing is exercise
- **Change of shirt** (if you sweat heavily)
- **Mints/gum**: Between tandas
- **Cash**: For entry, drinks

## Social Etiquette

### Accepting and Declining

**When accepting:**
- Smile and nod
- Meet your partner halfway
- Walk together to the floor

**When declining:**
- Simply look away (in cabeceo)
- Say "No, thank you" politely
- Don't make excuses or say "later"
- Don't accept someone else immediately after

### During the Dance

- **No teaching** on the social floor
- **No verbal corrections**
- Focus on connection, not perfection
- Match your partner's level

### After the Tanda

- Thank your partner sincerely
- Walk them back to their seat
- Don't immediately discuss the dance
- Positive comments only

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### For Beginners

❌ **Don't apologize constantly**
- One "sorry" is enough
- Then just focus on dancing

❌ **Don't teach or correct**
- The dance floor isn't a classroom
- Save feedback for practice

❌ **Don't monopolize one partner**
- Dance with different people
- This is how you improve

❌ **Don't stay seated all night**
- Take risks, ask people
- Everyone was a beginner once

### For Everyone

❌ **Don't walk across the floor**
- Go around the edge
- Respect dancing couples

❌ **Don't stop to chat mid-floor**
- Move to the edge
- Clear the dance space

❌ **Don't use phones while dancing**
- Full attention on partner
- Phone stays in bag/pocket

❌ **Don't drink too much**
- Coordination matters
- Nobody wants a drunk partner

## Advanced Codes

### Seating Arrangements

In traditional milongas:

- Women sit on one side
- Men on the other
- Couples can sit together
- Position indicates availability

### The Mirada

Before cabeceo, the "mirada" (look):

- Scanning the room for partners
- Making yourself visible
- Maintaining open body language
- Catching someone's attention

### Thanking the DJ

- Good DJs create the night's energy
- Thank them for great tandas
- This is tango community culture

## Your First Milonga

### Preparation

1. **Go with a friend** (less intimidating)
2. **Arrive early** (see the room, get comfortable)
3. **Observe first** (understand the vibe)
4. **Dance at your level** (don't oversell)

### Expectations

- You won't dance every tanda
- You might sit more than dance at first
- That's completely normal
- Use sitting time to watch and learn

<GamzeQuote>
Your first milonga might be 70% watching and 30% dancing. Your fiftieth might be 20% watching and 80% dancing. Both are perfect.
</GamzeQuote>

## Building Your Reputation

In the tango community, reputation matters:
