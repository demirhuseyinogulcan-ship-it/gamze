When planning your wedding dance, outfit selection is very important. Looking beautiful is as critical as being able to move comfortably. In this guide, I share my outfit recommendations for both brides and grooms.

<GamzeQuote>
One of the biggest mistakes I see after couples take dance lessons is not practicing in their actual wedding attire.

## Wedding Dress Selection

### Tango-Friendly Styles

#### 1. A-Line (Not Puffy)
- **Advantage**: Free leg movement
- **Disadvantage**: Train can be problematic

#### 2. Mermaid - CAUTION
- **Advantage**: Elegant look
- **Disadvantage**: Hard to take wide steps

<Callout type="warning" title="Mermaid Warning">
If mermaid dresses are tight below the knee, ocho and pivot movements become very difficult. Always test with dance!
</Callout>

#### 3. Tea-Length (Midi)
- **Advantage**: Feet visible, very easy movement
- **Disadvantage**: Less traditional look

#### 4. Two-Piece / Detachable Skirt
- **Advantage**: Long for ceremony, short for dance
- **Disadvantage**: Requires change time

### Wedding Dress Checklist

✅ **Shoulder movement**: Arms should move freely
✅ **Pivot ability**: Should be able to turn at waist
✅ **Step width**: Should be able to take at least 40cm steps
✅ **Train**: Gathered up or detachable so it won't be stepped on
✅ **Breathing**: Corset shouldn't be too tight

<Callout type="tip" title="Rehearsal Required!">
Take at least one lesson in full attire (including shoes) 2 weeks before the wedding. Practice the choreography in that outfit.
</Callout>

## Bridal Shoes

### Heel Height
- **If you're used to it**: 7-9 cm
- **Intermediate**: 5-7 cm
- **Safe choice**: 3-5 cm

### Sole
- **Leather sole**: Ideal for dance, slides
- **Rubber sole**: Safe but you can't turn

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
If your bridal shoes have rubber soles, you can have a professional add suede soles. Both safe and dance-friendly.
</Callout>

### Straps
- **Ankle strap**: Most secure, won't fall off
- **T-bar**: Beautiful and secure
- **Slip-on**: Risk of falling off!

## Groom's Attire

### Suit

#### Jacket
- Shouldn't restrict movement
- Shoulder seams should fit correctly
- Shouldn't be tight when buttoned

<Callout type="tip" title="Jacket Tip">
Stretch fabric suits look stylish and allow movement. Prices are the same as regular suits.
</Callout>

#### Pants
- Thigh and calf should be comfortable
- Shouldn't pull when walking
- Hem shouldn't touch shoes (shorten them)

### Groom's Shoes

#### Style
- Classic oxford or derby
- Leather or suede sole preferred
- Avoid thick rubber soles

#### Fit
- Should be comfortable for dancing
- Break them in before the wedding
- Consider insoles for comfort

## Practice Sessions

### What to Practice In

**Bride:**
- Similar heel height to wedding shoes
- Practice skirt if dress is long
- Hair up if that's the wedding style

**Groom:**
- Dress shoes (not sneakers)
- Similar pants fit
- Jacket for at least one rehearsal

### Timeline

| When | What |
|------|------|
| 8 weeks before | Start lessons |
| 4 weeks before | Finalize choreography |
| 2 weeks before | Full dress rehearsal |
| 1 week before | Final practice |
| Day before | Light review only |

<Callout type="warning" title="Don't Overdo It">
Don't practice the day of the wedding! You'll be tired and nervous enough. Trust your preparation.
</Callout>

## Emergency Kit

Pack these in your wedding day bag:

- **Heel protectors**: For outdoor photos
- **Moleskin**: For blisters
- **Fashion tape**: For wardrobe malfunctions
- **Stain remover pen**: Just in case
- **Backup shoes**: Flats for after the dance

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Never practicing in wedding clothes**
2. **Shoes that are too new (blisters!)**
3. **Train that gets stepped on**
4. **Corset too tight to breathe**
5. **Forgetting to break in shoes**

Your wedding dance should be about connection and joy, not worrying about your outfit. Prepare well, then forget about it and enjoy!
