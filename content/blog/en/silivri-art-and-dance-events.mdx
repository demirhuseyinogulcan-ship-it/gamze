Istanbul... The city we fall in love with but sometimes get tired of. Horn sounds, never-ending constructions, crowds of people...
Sometimes one just looks for **silence** and **aesthetics**.

Exactly at this point, **Silivri**, the western gate of Istanbul, offers us a wonderful shelter. But not only with its sea and meatballs; now with its developing **art and dance ecosystem** too.

As a Silivri resident and art educator, I watch this transformation in the culture-art life of our district with pride and as Gamze Tango, I take part right in the heart of this transformation.

## Silivri is Changing Shells

Silivri, which used to be a summer resort visited "from summer to summer", now has a population that lives, produces, and is hungry for art for 12 months.

*   Theaters in the culture center,
*   Painting workshops,
*   And of course increasing **dance studios...**

People no longer want to be stuck in malls to socialize, they want to do activities that will nourish their souls.

## Why Tango in Silivri?

Going to a tango course in the center of Istanbul can sometimes turn into torture. Rush hour traffic, parking problem... your energy spared for dance runs out on the road.

However, time flows **slower** and **with higher quality** in Silivri.

### 1. Stress-Free Transportation, Maximum Focus 🚗
When you come to our studio, you don't spend half an hour looking for a parking spot. You park your car, inhale the sea air, and start the lesson "soft as cotton". Tango requires a calm mind and Silivri offers this calmness to you naturally.

### 2. Boutique and Sincere Events 🎻
Our tango nights (milongas) are not fabricated entertainments.
Sometimes in our studio by candlelight, sometimes in a stylish cafe by the seaside, sometimes in the garden of a vineyard house...
We dance with few people, pure conversation, quality music. Everyone knows each other's name here.

### 3. Ideal for Weekend Getaway 🏖️
Do you live in the center of Istanbul but want to take a breath on the weekend?
How about coming to Silivri on Saturday, taking your walk/breakfast on the beach during the day, and joining our **Tango Workshop** in the afternoon? Both vacation and art, together.

## What Do We Do As Gamze Tango?

We don't just "give lessons and send away" in our studio in Silivri. We are trying to make this place a **cultural meeting point**.

*   **Movie Nights:** We watch tango-themed movies and chat about them.
*   **Music Recitals:** We explain the history of tango music, instruments (bandoneon).
*   **Practice Hours:** Our door is open to all dance lovers on certain days of the week; come, drink our tea, dance, watch.

**Take a Step into Art**

In spite of those saying "There is no life in Silivri", the most beautiful form of art is lived here.
If you also want to escape from the noise and step into that magical world of Argentine tango in the peace of Silivri, we are waiting for you.

White-collar, student, retiree, or housewife... It doesn't matter who you are.
The moment you walk through the door, the chaos outside ends, **the dance begins.**
