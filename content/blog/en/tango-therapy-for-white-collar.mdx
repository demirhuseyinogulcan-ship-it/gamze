09:00 AM, 06:00 PM (of course if you can leave).
You were exposed to the blue light of the computer all day in those gray plazas or your home office.
Your shoulders are tense, your neck hurts, and your brain is full of words like "Urgent", "ASAP", "Revise". 🤯

Going home and falling asleep in front of Netflix is tempting, I know. But this doesn't rest you, it only "numbs" you.
You start the next day tired again.

Shall I tell you a secret? 60% of my students are white-collar workers. Bankers, developers, marketers... And they all come here for one thing: **"To Reset" (Return to Factory Settings).**

We call this **"Tango Therapy"**.

## Why Is Tango the Antidote to Corporate Life?

### 1. It Forcefully Silences the Mind (Meditation Effect) 🧠
You can think about work while running in the gym. You can plan the meeting while walking.
But **you cannot think of anything else while doing Tango.**
It is impossible. Because at that moment you have to feel your partner's signal, hear the rhythm of the music, and plan the next step. Your brain is forced to exit work mode and enter "The Now" mode.
When you leave the lesson, you say "My head is empty, I feel light as a bird".

### 2. End to "Computer Hunchback" (Posture Correction) 🦴
Shoulders slumped forward from sitting at the desk, head bowed forward. Typical "plaza person" posture.
What is the basis of tango? **Upright posture, open chest, long neck.**
In lessons, you constantly receive the warning "Lengthen your spine, take your shoulders back". A few months later, you realize that you sit much more confidently and upright not only in dance but also at the meeting table.

### 3. Hierarchy-Free Socialization 🤝
You are a manager, an assistant, or a specialist at work. You have a label.
On the tango floor, there is only "Leader" or "Follower".
The General Manager and the intern dance under equal conditions in the same song. That sincere environment where business cards are left at the door and no one judges anyone by their "title" softens egos.

## Routes After Work in Silivri and Istanbul

If you are working on the European Side or around Silivri, Gamze Tango lessons are adjusted exactly to after-work hours (around 19:30 - 20:00).

*   **Silivri Team:** Going down to the seaside, taking sea air, and coming to class after a busy day is a therapy in itself.
*   **Kadıköy/Taksim Team:** Instead of steering in the busiest traffic hour, spending that hour with dance and returning home when traffic clears... This is called "time management"! 😉

## Try and See the Difference

That day when you say "I am very tired, I can't come to class" is actually the day you **need the class the most**.
Physical fatigue is thrown away with dance. Mental fatigue is erased with music.

**End the Meeting, Start the Dance!**

Close your computer, loosen your tie, change your high heels (with comfortable dance shoes).
What will be good for you is not an Excel file; it is a **Tango song.**

First dose of therapy is on me! 💊
