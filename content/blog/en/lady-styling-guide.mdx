In traditional tango, the follower responds to the leader. But lady styling transforms that response into art. It's where you add your voice, your musicality, your personality - while staying perfectly in sync with your partner.

<GamzeQuote>
Following is not passive. A good follower is like a great jazz musician - responding to the conversation while adding their own brilliant improvisations.

## What is Lady Styling?

Lady styling encompasses:
- **Posture**: How you hold yourself
- **Technique**: The quality of your movement
- **Adornos**: Decorative embellishments
- **Presence**: Your energy and expression
- **Musicality**: Your response to the music

<Callout type="info" title="Not Just for Women">
While called "lady" styling historically, these techniques are valuable for any follower, regardless of gender.
</Callout>

## Foundation: Posture

### Upper Body
- **Head**: Slightly lifted, gaze soft
- **Shoulders**: Down and back, relaxed
- **Chest**: Open, not collapsed
- **Arms**: Toned but not stiff

### Core
- **Engagement**: Constant but not clenched
- **Dissociation**: Upper and lower body can move independently
- **Stability**: Center of gravity controlled

### Lower Body
- **Hips**: Free to move, not locked
- **Legs**: Active, reaching from the hip
- **Feet**: Articulated, expressive

<GamzeQuote>
Beautiful styling starts with beautiful posture. Everything else is built on this foundation.

## The Art of Following

### Active vs. Passive Following

| Passive Following | Active Following |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Waiting for lead | Responding instantly |
| Moving to position | Moving through position |
| Tolerating embrace | Contributing to embrace |
| Hearing music | Expressing music |

### Key Principles

<TangoTerm
  term="Intención"
  pronunciation="in-ten-SYON"
  definition="Intention. The energy and direction you bring to each movement."
/>

1. **Projection**: Extend beyond your body
2. **Completion**: Finish each movement fully
3. **Resistance**: Appropriate tension in embrace
4. **Sensitivity**: Feel micro-changes in lead

## Adornos: The Art of Embellishment

Adornos are the follower's solo voice. They happen in the spaces the leader provides.

### When to Add Adornos
✅ During pauses
✅ Musical accents
✅ Between pivots
✅ When leader is stationary

### When NOT to Add Adornos
❌ During led movement
❌ When off-balance
❌ In crowded spaces
❌ At the expense of connection

### Essential Adornos

<TangoTerm
  term="Lápiz"
  pronunciation="LA-pis"
  definition="Drawing circles or lines on the floor with your toe."
/>

<TangoTerm
  term="Golpe"
  pronunciation="GOL-pe"
  definition="A rhythmic tap of the foot, accenting the music."
/>

<TangoTerm
  term="Caricia"
  pronunciation="ka-RI-sia"
  definition="Caress. Your foot stroking your own or partner's leg."
/>

## Musicality for Followers

### Matching the Orchestra

| Style | Quality | Adornos |
|-------|---------|---------|
| D'Arienzo | Sharp, staccato | Quick golpes |
| Di Sarli | Smooth, legato | Flowing lápiz |
| Pugliese | Dramatic | Dramatic pauses |
| Troilo | Lyrical | Sustained lines |

### Finding the Moments
1. **Listen**: Know the music before dancing
2. **Anticipate**: Feel where accents will come
3. **Respond**: Add your expression
4. **Let go**: Not every moment needs decoration

<GamzeQuote>
The best musical followers I know listen to tango daily - while cooking, driving, working. The music becomes part of them.
