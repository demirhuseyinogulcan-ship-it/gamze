Abrazo - "embrace" in Spanish - is the heart of tango. The physical connection you establish with your partner determines the quality of the dance. Without a good abrazo, there is no good tango.

<GamzeQuote>
Abrazo means two bodies beating with one heart. Technique is important, but feeling is more important.
