Adornos - embellishments - are like tango's candy. After the basic dance is complete, they are personal expressions you can add to the moment and music. In this article, we enter the world of tango embellishments.

<GamzeQuote>
Adornos are not mandatory, but they add your personality to tango. You listen to music while decorating it.

## What Are Adornos?

<TangoTerm term="Adornos" pronunciation="a-DOR-nos" definition="Embellishments. Decorative foot and leg movements added to basic movement." />

### Adorno Philosophy

Embellishments are:
- **Optional** - Not required
- **Musical** - Matching the rhythm
- **Personal** - Style expression
- **Measured** - Not excessive

## Embellishment Principles

### When to Embellish?

| Time | Appropriate? |
|------|--------------|
| While waiting | ✅ Yes |
| During parada | ✅ Yes |
| Between steps | ⚠️ Careful |
| During movement | ❌ No |
| While receiving lead | ❌ No |

### Embellishment Rules

1. **Don't break connection** - Abrazo must be maintained
2. **Don't miss the lead** - First follow, then embellish
3. **Don't trip your partner** - Watch distance
4. **Match the music** - According to rhythm
5. **Be measured** - Not every step

<Callout type="warning" title="Caution">
Embellishments add extra beauty to the dance, but the real priority is lead-follow quality. First establish the foundation!
