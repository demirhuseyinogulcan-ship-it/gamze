So you've decided to take your first tango lesson! Congratulations - you're about to embark on a beautiful journey. But I know that first step can feel intimidating. In this guide, I'll share everything you need to know to walk into that first lesson with confidence.

<GamzeQuote>
Every tango dancer in the world started exactly where you are now - not knowing the first step. That's perfectly okay.

## What to Wear

### Shoes
- **Women**: Low heels (3-5 cm) or flat dance shoes
- **Men**: Leather-soled dress shoes or dance shoes
- **Avoid**: Rubber soles, sneakers, flip-flops

<Callout type="tip" title="Shoe Tip">
You don't need tango shoes for your first lesson. Any comfortable shoes with a leather or suede sole that allow you to pivot will work.

### Clothing
- **Women**: Comfortable pants or a knee-length skirt
- **Men**: Comfortable pants and a breathable shirt
- **General**: Clothes that allow movement, not too loose

### What to Avoid
❌ Heavy jewelry (can hurt your partner)
❌ Strong perfume
❌ Very baggy clothes
❌ Restrictive jeans

## What to Expect

### Typical First Lesson Structure

1. **Warm-up** (5-10 min)
   - Basic stretches
   - Posture work
   
2. **Fundamentals** (30-40 min)
   - Walking
   - Embrace basics
   - Simple steps
   
3. **Practice** (10-15 min)
   - Put it together
   - Questions and feedback

## Mindset Tips

### Do
✅ Be patient with yourself
✅ Listen more than think
✅ Feel the music
✅ Laugh at mistakes
✅ Ask questions

### Don't
❌ Compare yourself to others
❌ Try to memorize everything
❌ Expect perfection
❌ Be afraid to make mistakes

<GamzeQuote>
The best students are not the ones who never make mistakes - they're the ones who make mistakes and keep smiling.

## Common First-Lesson Fears

### "I have two left feet"
Reality: Coordination is learned, not inherited. Everyone feels awkward at first.

### "I'll embarrass myself"
Reality: Your instructor has seen it all. Nothing you do will be new or embarrassing.

### "I'm not musical"
Reality: Musicality develops with exposure. You don't need to be a musician.

### "I'm too old"
Reality: I've taught students from 18 to 75. Tango has no age limit.

## Physical Preparation

### The Day Before
- Get good sleep
- Stay hydrated
- Light stretching if desired

### The Day Of
- Eat something light
- Arrive 10 minutes early
- Bring water

### What You Might Feel After
- Tired legs (that's normal!)
- Sore feet
- A strong desire to come back 😊

## Questions to Ask Your Instructor

- How long until I can social dance?
- What should I practice at home?
- Do you recommend group or private lessons?
- What music should I listen to?

## After Your First Lesson

### Homework
1. Listen to tango music daily
2. Practice walking at home
3. Watch tango videos on YouTube
4. Book your next lesson!

### Realistic Timeline
- **1-3 months**: Basic steps and walking
- **3-6 months**: Simple combinations
- **6-12 months**: Ready for milonga
- **Lifetime**: Continuous growth

<Callout type="success" title="You're Ready!">
The hardest part is showing up. Once you're there, just breathe, be present, and enjoy the journey. I can't wait to dance with you!
