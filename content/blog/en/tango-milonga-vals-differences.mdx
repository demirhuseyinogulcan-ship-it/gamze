When you first go to a milonga, you'll notice that not all the music the DJ plays is "tango." Tango, milonga, and vals - these three music types form the foundation of milonga nights. Each has its own unique rhythm, character, and dance style.

<GamzeQuote>
Tango expresses passion, milonga joy, vals romance. To love all three is to love tango completely.
