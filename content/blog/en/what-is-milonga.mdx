When you first hear the word "milonga," it can be confusing. Is it a type of music? A dance? A venue? Actually, it's all of these! But most importantly, a milonga is a community, a family, a culture.

<GamzeQuote>
The milonga is the heart of tango. There you apply what you've learned, meet new people, and experience the soul of tango.
