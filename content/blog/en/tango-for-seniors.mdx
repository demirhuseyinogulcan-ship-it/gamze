"I'm too old for tango" is the biggest misconception. In Buenos Aires milongas, you'll see milongueros dancing in their 70s and 80s. Tango is a dance meant to be danced for a lifetime, and the best time to start is now.

My youngest student is 18, my most experienced student is 78. Both are learning with the same excitement. Tango knows no age.
