Oh no! Only a few days left until the wedding.

Wedding dress rehearsals, groom suit selection, invitation distribution... and that topic you said "we'll handle eventually" is at the door: **The First Dance.**

If you are reading this article right now, you probably typed this into Google in panic: *"Can dance be learned 1 month before the wedding?"* or *"How to do the easiest wedding dance?"*

Take a deep breath. 🧘‍♀️
Teacher Gamze is here and gives you a clear answer: **YES, IT CAN BE DONE!**

I even speak assertively; I have had many couples who came 1 week before the wedding and whom I put on stage "ready" and smiling.

## What is Our "Emergency" Plan?

If our time is limited, our strategy is built on "Simplicity & Elegance".

If we have 1 month (or less), instead of complex tango figures or challenging lifts, we focus on:

### 1. Smart Choreography 🧠
I prepare a smart choreography designed according to the flow of the music, saving you from the trouble of "counting steps". We choose moves that are easy to memorize but make people say "Wow, how compatible they are!" when looked at from the outside.

### 2. Posture and Hold (Most Important!) ✨
Believe me, even if you do the most complex figure in the world, it looks bad if you are slouching. But if you just hug each other correctly and stand tall, even if you just walk, you look "noble". We focus most on your posture in crash courses.

### 3. Photo Moments (Posing) 📸
We determine 3-4 "signature poses" that will look great in your wedding photos. You strike these poses at the beginning, middle, and end of the dance. This gives you both a chance to rest and offers your photographer a chance to capture great shots.

## Crash Package Options

According to your time, we can apply the following programs in my Istanbul (Kadıköy/Taksim) or Silivri studio:

*   **4-Lesson Rescue Package (1 Month):** 1 lesson per week. Introduction, development, conclusion, and final rehearsal. It is the ideal minimum duration.
*   **Intensive Camp (2 Weeks):** 2 lessons per week. It is a bit more intense but muscle memory forms faster.
*   **Single Lesson "Tactical" Training:** For those saying *"Teacher, the wedding is tomorrow!"*. (Yes, this happened too!) A 2-hour work where I only show the entrance to the stage, basic waltz step, and greeting. Much better than nothing.

## No Panic, There is a Solution

Grooms-to-be are generally more nervous saying *"I can't do it, we will be disgraced"*. I always tell them: **"I will never make you do something on stage that will disgrace you."**

We will proceed with risk-free, safe steps that suit you.

### Music Choice is Critical! 🎵
If time is short, we must choose songs where the rhythm is heard very clearly and which do not tire you. If your song is not ready, we can choose together from my "Fast to Learn Songs" list.
